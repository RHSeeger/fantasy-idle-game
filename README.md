This project was an attempt at creating an idle/incremental browser game based on Master of Magic
(an old, wonderful game).  However, it's gotten to the point where I've realized it doesn't make
for a good game, because the parts of MoM that are the most fun are the parts that cannot really
be "idle".

It was certainly a fun learning experience for me. Javascript has changed in a number of ways
since I last worked on a project for myself (outside of work) and working on this had me delve
into some of those changes. I don't think the code in this project is really representative of
what would be considered good programming style for Javascript; I was more after learning about
the newer features of the language (modules, etc) than making sure I followed the same style
that others do.
